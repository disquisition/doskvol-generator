# Doskvol Generator

An unofficial generator for Blades in the Dark.

## Available Scripts

Runs the generator in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Compresses the production build to `doskvol-generator.zip`.<br>
If `doskvol-generator.zip` already exists, its contents will be synced with the `build` folder.
